## The ChatGPT prompt

> I need a PHP website that displays a random Danish verb, a random Danish conjunction and a random short situation from the "Spongebob Squarepants" TV show in English. Then the website prompts users to write a sentence using all three random values. Upon submission, it will use the OpenAI API to validate whether the entered sentence is grammatically correct in Danish.
>
> The verbs and conjunctions to choose from will be stored separately in the best fitting format. I will later edit them to have all the options to choose from.
>
> The random Spongebob Situation should also come from asking the OpenAI API. However, have a locally-hosted list as a backup as well.
>
> Do not explain. Write only code. Explain in the code comments if needed.
